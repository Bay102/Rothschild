            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <Reveal>
              <p>
                Larry and Rhoda Rothschild embarked on a gastronomic adventure
                driven by their desire to share their culinary creativity with
                the community. Their journey began humbly with a Jewish deli,
                embodying the essence of tradition, quality, and community
                connection. Initially a local establishment, it delighted
                patrons with classic Jewish delicacies like corned beef and
                pastrami sandwiches, matzo ball soup, and hoagies. Through the
                years, its reputation grew through word-of-mouth and the
                unwavering excellence of its offerings, solidifying its place as
                a beloved fixture in the community.

                {' '}
                Fueled by their entrepreneurial spirit, the Rothschilds extended
                their reach, establishing a series of restaurants and catering
                businesses on the outskirts of Philadelphia. Each venue exuded a
                unique charm, blending their distinctive tastes with warm
                hospitality.

                The Rothschild Trust envisions a world where the service
                industry is celebrated for its contributions to society, and
                creativity, healing, and innovation are at the forefront of its
                mission. The Trust sees a future where individuals within the
                service industry are empowered, equipped, and supported to
                thrive in their craft and make meaningful contributions to their
                community.

                The Trust's vision is deeply rooted in the Rothschilds'
                commitment to community service and empowerment. Just as the

                jobs, serve locally sourced ingredients, and foster
                personalized, community-oriented service, the Trust seeks to
                empower individuals within the service industry to be pioneers
                of change, making an impact both in and outside their field.
