              strategic alliances with individuals and organizations who share our
              goals and believe in our mission. Through planned and one-time giving,

              and become co-developers of change. Whether it's a one-time gift or a

            <h3>Our Vision</h3>
            <p>
              The Rothschild Trust envisions a world where the service industry is
              celebrated for its contributions to society, and creativity, healing,
              and innovation are at the forefront of its mission. The Trust sees a
              future where individuals within the service industry are empowered,
              equipped, and supported to thrive in their craft and make meaningful
              contributions to their community.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Trust's vision is deeply rooted in the Rothschilds' commitment to
              community service and empowerment. Just as the Rothschilds used their
              gastronomic ventures to create local jobs, serve locally sourced
              ingredients, and foster personalized, community-oriented service, the
              Trust seeks to empower individuals within the service industry to be
              pioneers of change, making an impact both in and outside their field.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Trust's vision is anchored in its five cardinal values: Service,
              Hospitality, Passion, Fun, and Integrity. These values reflect the
              Rothschilds' ethos of selfless giving,
